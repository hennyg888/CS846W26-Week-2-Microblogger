vibe coded microblogger according to the following specifications:
I want you to build a Microblogging web application (Twitter-like)

Features:
Create a user profile
Post short text updates (limited length)
View a chronological feed of posts from all users
Like posts
Reply to posts (one level deep)
Login to user profile
View a user’s profile and their posts

Constraints:
No private messaging
No retweets / reposts
No follower graph (global feed only)

Note that I want you to create requirements from the description above, generate code that has all the features, is of high quality, and is highly performant for the user.

Started with chatgpt 4o but switched to Raptor mini with thinking.

Run server locally with ./start_server.sh and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
